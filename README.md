# Prime Factorization Calculator

### How to run
```bash
dotnet run
```

### TODO
- [x] Declare two List<int> objects to store the prime factors of two integers a and b.
- [x] Write an algorithm to implement the factorization process. The base program defined
an integer array variable named primes to represent the prime numbers less than 100.
You can use this variable directly in your factorization. However, this variable is not
absolutely needed. If this variable (the information about prime numbers less than 100)
is not available, how do you implement the factorization process? 3 Extra points for
implementations without using this variable.
- [x] Write an algorithm to find the GCF of two numbers based on their prime factors.
- [x] Write an algorithm to find the LCM of two numbers based on their GCF and prime
factors. Note that you cannot compute the LCM of two numbers as their product
divided by their GCF. You must extract their common prime factors and then multiply
them by their remaining prime factors.
- [x] Write code to display the results of factorization and the values of GCF and LCM
computed. The output should be similar to the one shown in Figure 1.
- [x] Discuss other possible implementations or improvements.
